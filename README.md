# Trickjs

Tiny lib for dynamic declarative JS components. Can be helpful e.g. to replace jQuery in WordPress sites. Minimized lib is about 600B. Though not for SPA and thousands components per page (probably).

## Major features:

- No V-DOM
- No hooks
- No JSX
- No CSS-in-Js
- No Babel/Webpack/transpilation
- Components have props and are easily stateful through JS closures
- Direct DOM updates
- Plain old CSS (we missed it, right?)

Just what you need to declare dynamic components on a page.
